Guide to run the code:

The "ReadMe file" describes how to RUN the code related to the seismicity forecasting based on a Bayesian spatio-temporal ETAS model. This code has been originally developed in MATLAB by Hossein Ebrahimian (University of Naples Federico II, UNINA, Italy) and Fatemeh Jalayer (Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, IRDR, University College London, UK & University of Naples Federico II) in the following two publications (the methodology is demonstrated by retrospective early forecasting of seismicity associated with the 2016 Central Italy and 2017-2019 Western Iran seismic sequence activities):
